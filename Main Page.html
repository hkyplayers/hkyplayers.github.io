        <h2>History of the NHL</h2>
<p>The NHL (National Hockey League) forrmed in 1917 with 4 teams: The Montreal Canadiens, The Toronto Arenas (Later The Toronto St. Patricks and now The Toronto Maple Leafs), The Montreal Wanderers, and the Ottawa Senators. Later, on January 2, 1918 the Montreal Wanderers' rink burned down and then folded. After that, the NHL was down to 3 teams! In 1919, the Quebec Buldogs joined the NHL but later relocated to Hamilton and became the Hamilton Tigers in 1920. In 1924, the Montreal Marroons and the Boston Bruins joined the NHL. The Boston Bruins became the first American team to join the NHL. In 1925, the Hamilton Tigers relocated to New York and became the New York Americans. The Pittsburgh Pirates joined in 1925. In 1926, 3 teams joined the NHL, The New York Rangers, The Detroit Cougars (Later The Detroit Falcons and now The Detroit Red Wings), and The Chicago Blackhawks. In 1930 the Pittsburgh Pirates relocated to Philadelphia and became the Quakers which folded a year later. This was the start of The Great Depression which was when a lot of people lost their jobs and lost a lot of money. The Ottawa Senators relocated to St Louis and became the Eagles which later folded. The Montreal Maroons folded in 1938 then the Americans folded too. Then, in 1942 the NHL was down to 6 teams! The 6 teams were known as the Original 6, were The Montreal Canadiens, The Toronto Maple Leafs, The New York Rangers, The Detroit Red Wings, The Boston Bruins, and The Chicago Blackhawks. They were the only 6 teams in the NHL. In 1967, the Expansion era began. That is when 6 more teams joined the NHL. The Philadelphia Flyers, The Pittsburgh Penguins, The Minnesota North Stars, The St. Louis Blues, The Oakland Seals, and The los Angeles Kings. The Vancover Canucks and Buffalo Sabres joined in 1970. Later, the WHA (World Hockey Association) formed and had good players like Gordie Howe and future star Wayne Gretzky. The New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames (Now the Calgary Flames) joined in 1972 and in 1974 The Philadelphia Flyers won their first out of 2 Stanley Cups. They were the first expanison team to win the Stanley Cup. In that year, The Kansas City Scouts and The Washington Capitals joined. In 1976, The Calafornia Golden Seals (Originally The Oakland Seals) relocated to Clevland and became The Clevland Barons but in 1978, they merged with The Minnesota North Stars. The Kansas City Scouts moved to Colorado and became The Colorado Rockies. In 1979, the WHA folded and 4 teams from the WHA joined the NHL, The Edmonton Oilers, The Quebec Nordiques, The Winnipeg Jets, and The Hardford Whalers were the 4 teams that joined the NHL. In that year, the rule in the NHL was passed that all players hat to wear a helmet. If a player played before the rule was passed, he was allowed to not wear a helmet. In 1980, The Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary and became the Calgary flames. In 1982, The Colorado Rockies relocated to New Jersey and became The New Jersey Devils. Around 1989, Wayne Gretzky became the best hockey player of all time in the NHL after Gordie Howe. The San Jose Sharks joined in 1991 and in 1992, The Ottawa Senators came back in the NHL since 1934 and the Tampa Bay Lightning also joined in 1992. In 1993, The Montreal Canadiens won their 24th Stanley Cup and the last one for any NHL team in Canada. The Anaheim Ducks (Mighty Ducks of Anaheim until 2011) joined in 1993 too and The Florida Panthers also joined in 1993. Also, The Minnesota North Stars relocated to Dallas and became The Dallas Stars. In 1994, The New York Rangers won the Stanley cup after a 54 year cup drought that started in 1940. In 1995, The Quebec Nordiques relocated to Colorado and became The Colorado Avalanche. Then, The Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix and became The Phoenix Coyotes (Now The Arizona Coyotes). In 1997, The Hartford Whalers relocated to Carolina and became the Carolina Hurricanes. The Nashville Predators and The Atlanta Thrashers joined in 1998. In 2000, The Minnesota Wild and The Columbus Blue Jackets joined. In 2001, a really beautiful moment took place. The Colorado Avalanche won the Stanley Cup and it was Ray Bourque's first Stanley Cup in 22 years and when Joe Sakic got the cup he handed it to Ray Bourque and he raised it and was a emotional moment for fans and himself. In 2005, there was a NHL lockout where players and coaches couldn't agree on how much they got paid. In 2011, The Atlanta Thrashers relocated to Winnipeg and became The Winnipeg Jets. In 2017, The Vegas Golden Knights joined the NHL. There you have it, the history of the NHL.</p>
